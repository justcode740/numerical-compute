# Numerical Linear Algebra in Halo2

the goal is to implement proof system based on halo2 to verify linear algebra operations
like svd, qr, eigen decomposition.

### setup

`src/reference`: implementation of algebra computation in plain rust

`src/zk`: halo2 zk circuits

run `cargo test` in root folder to run tests
run `cargo test` in `src/zk` for zk specific tests
